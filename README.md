### country_code_data_utils.ipynb

The **`country_code_data_utils.ipynb`** notebook is a crucial component responsible for fetching, processing, and storing country code data retrieved from the XY API. This API supplies a list of countries, each identified by a unique code (e.g., 'CH' for Switzerland), which we store in our database for future reference.
