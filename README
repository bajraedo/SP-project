Usage
country_code_data_utils.ipynb
The country_code_data_utils.ipynb notebook is a crucial component responsible for fetching, processing, and storing country code data retrieved from the XY API. This API supplies a list of countries, each identified by a unique code (e.g., 'CH' for Switzerland), which we store in our database for future reference.

Instructions:
Order of Execution: Run each cell in sequential order to avoid any dependency issues.

Data Update Process: If there are new versions of the data available, follow these steps:

Uncomment the 'drop table' code to delete the existing table.
Run the cells to execute the deletion.
Comment the 'drop table' code again to prevent accidental deletion in the future.
Fetching and Processing Data: Once the 'drop table' code is commented again, run all cells to fetch and process the new data. Ensure all cells execute successfully.

Notes:
The data processed within this notebook is utilized in other sections of the application, making its accurate processing crucial.
Regularly check for updates from the XY API to ensure the database remains current.
