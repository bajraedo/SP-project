# Minimum requirement for the project work (max. 8 points):
# The project must be a Scientific Programming (SP) project, i.e., based on the content of the SP module. - DONE
# The project must integrate several topics presented in the module, at a minimum these are the following: 
# (1) Collection of real-world data - DONE
# (2) Data preparation (e.g. strings to numerical using regular expressions) - DONE? check with the tutor
# (3) Use of Python built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples) and pandas data frames - DONE-> (all??)
# (4) Use of conditional statements, loop control statements and loops - DONE
# (5) Use of procedural programming or object-oriented programming (one of these or both) - DONE
# (6) Use of tables, vizualizations/graphics for data exploration - In progress
# (7) Integration of a statistical analyses (e.g. correlation analysis, statistical test); must contain a p-value. - In progress
# (8) Making the data, Python code, Jupyter notebooks, etc. available on Moodle - In progress


# Additional points for the project work if the following is met (max 6 points):
# (1) Creativity of implementation (creative is everything which was not part of the lessons and exercises) - DONE
# (2) Use of a Web Scraper or Web API to collect data (must be part of the Python programming code)  - DONE
# (3) Use of a database (e.g. SQLite, PostgreSQL) and SQL-queries (must be part of the Python programming code) - DONE
# (4) Use of Docker or a cloud service (e.g. Amazon EC2, Amazon Sagemaker, Azure Machine Learning studio) - In progress
# (5) Creation of a simple web application to present data and analysis results - In progress (first part done, analysis results pending)
# (6) Making the Python code/Jupyter notebooks publicly available in a GitHub repo (exclude large data sets using .gitignore) - DONE
