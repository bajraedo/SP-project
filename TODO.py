# have maybe subfolders for user/quiz/country
# Improve db queries (not building always new connection, use existing one)
# Make sentence structure so that it can be used in the future for quiz
# have radio buttons send answer back to the python script
# increase user highscore points depending on how he managed to answer the quiz
# have a leaderboard with some graphics
# end of quiz show statistical data like -> gini table maybe Balkendiagramm wo am meisten lÃ¤nder etc (first clarify what to show)
# (langugages map to country)
# Important: at the end both will have knowledge about reading/writing to a database, using a REST API, and creating a web application with Flask.
# Procedure will be same -> think what data is needed for example population, get population from db, calculate what you need and pass it to flask


# setup docker
# maybe gitignore, the database
# setup requirements.txt?
# update README.md
